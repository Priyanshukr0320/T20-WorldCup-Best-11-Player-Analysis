# T20 World Cup 2022-23 Player Performance Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the T20 World Cup 2022-23 Player Performance Analysis project! This project aims to analyze the performance of all players in the 2022-23 T20 Cricket World Cup and identify the best possible playing XI based on our analysis. 

## Project Summary

- Objective: Analyze player performance data from the T20 World Cup 2022-23 and determine an optimal playing XI.
- Tools Used:
  - Python for data preprocessing and analysis.
  - Pandas for handling and cleaning data.
  - Power BI for data visualization and querying.

## Project Structure

1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Raw data in JSON format is preprocessed using Python and Pandas.
   - Null values are handled, and data is cleaned and organized.

2. Data Analysis:
   - The processed data is analyzed to assess player performance metrics.
   - Various statistical and analytical methods are applied to extract meaningful insights.

3. Visualization:
   - Power BI is used to create visualizations and dashboards to represent player performance data.
   - Interactive queries and reports are generated to support the decision-making process for the best playing XI.
